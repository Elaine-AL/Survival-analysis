### Survival Analysis

You will need the **_Survival_** and **_Survminer_** package.

```{r}

mortalityBack = mortalityBack %>% mutate(event = ifelse(is.na(mortalityBack$Burial), yes = 0, no = 1))
mortalityBack = mortalityBack %>% mutate(censored = ifelse(is.na(mortalityBack$Burial), yes = 1, no = 0))


summary(mortalityBack$Death_to_Burial)

Surv(mortalityBack$Death_to_Burial, mortalityBack$event) [1:10]

msurvival = survfit(Surv(time = mortalityBack$Death_to_Burial) ~ 1)
summary(msurvival)
plot(msurvival, ylab = "Survival probability", xlab = "Days")

ggsurvplot(fit = survfit(Surv(time = mortalityBack$Death_to_Burial) ~ mortalityBack$Fundraising, data = mortalityBack), 
           ylab = "Survival probability", xlab = "Days", risk.table = TRUE, palette = "rainbow", legend.labs = c("No", "Yes"), legend.title = "Fundraising"
               )

```




It is clear that those which had NOT requested for a fundraise had the lowest survival probability, while those that had requested for a fundraise had the highest survival probability. This is logically true since most likely for those that had requested for a fundraise were still collecting funds for the burial ceremony.
